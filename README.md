### Exercise:

#### Create a basic Angular app to display Star Wars ship profiles using data from https://swapi.dev/api/starships/

- [x] Tha app name should be Star Wars Ship Repository
- [x] The app should be comprised of a login page and a main page
- [x] The login page should utilize a basic mock auth-service for authorization.

> It is fine to hardcode this data (list of names, username and passwords that are granted access).

The main page should consist of the following:

- [x] title bar – span the entire width of the viewable area and contain the app name (left), logged in username (right) and an option to logout
- [x] left pane – navigable list to select from available starships (load the first ship by default)
- [x] right pane - custom component to render the content of the selected starship

- [x] Additional Requirement: Each starship contains a reference to film appearances (“films”). Display the name of each film under the starship profile in chronological order.
